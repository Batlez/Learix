This is the batch file from the tweakcentral.net website. It's over two years old now, and I don't recommend using it because it could harm/worsen your fps, latency, and performance. The file downloaded from the website is encrypted and cannot be read. However, I decrypted it and decided to post it here. Please have fun with it!
